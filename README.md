Objective:
To build a linear regression model to predict housing prices in California based on various features such as average rooms per dwelling, population, and income.

Key Activities:

Data Collection:
Load the California housing dataset.
Data Exploration:
Examine the dataset to understand the structure and main features.
Data Preprocessing:
Split the data into features and target variable.
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training:
Train a linear regression model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Make predictions on the test data.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score.
Visualization:
Plot the actual vs. predicted housing prices to visualize the model's performance.
Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Key Insights:

Model Performance:
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score provide insights into how well the model predicts housing prices.
Feature Importance:
Understanding which features most significantly impact housing prices can offer valuable insights for real estate analysis and decision-making.
Visualization:
The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices helps in identifying patterns and potential areas where the model might be underperforming.
